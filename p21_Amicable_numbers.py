# Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).

# If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

# For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

# Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under n.

# Approach amicable numbers are such that sum of proper divisors of a = b and sum of proper divisors of b = a
# such numbers a, b are called as amicable numbers
# you need a dictionary to store the sum of proper divisors of each number
# there are some self amicable numbers 
# in the for loop for i = 220 the values of a and b will be 
# a = 284, b = 220
# to remove the self amicable numbers we need to check if i != b

## Approach 2 you can calculate all the divisors sum once and store them in a auxillary array
