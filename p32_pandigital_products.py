# We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234, is 1 through 5 pandigital.

# The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 Ã— 186 = 7254, containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

# Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity can be written as a 1 through n pandigital.

# Hint: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only include it once in your sum 1.

# one approach is to iterate through all the numbers in the range of the given number of digits and check if the number is pandigital or not.


# the better approach is by using the property of pandigital numbers.
# if the sum of digits of multiplier, multiplican and product is equal to the number of digits then the number is pandigital.
# so if the number of digits is 9 we only need to iterate for numbers less than 10000.
# this is because 99*99 = 9801 -> 8 digits if you increase either the multiplicand and the multiplier we will get a number with more than 9 digits.
# so those all are redundant calculations the limit will be under the 10000 mark

# for 4 digits the limit is less than 100
# for 6 digits the limit is less than 1000
